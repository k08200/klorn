/**
 * Delete a user and ALL of their data. Single source of truth so the
 * self-service account-deletion route and the admin delete-user route can never
 * drift apart (Google restricted-scope review requires users to be able to
 * request full deletion of their data, incl. all Google-derived data).
 *
 * Completeness: 41 of the 42 user-scoped relations declare `onDelete: Cascade`,
 * so deleting the `User` row removes them automatically (emails, attention
 * items, attachments, sender traits, linked accounts, devices, etc.). The one
 * exception is `LlmUsageLog`, whose `userId` is `onDelete: SetNull` (it
 * anonymizes rather than blocks) — we delete it explicitly first so account
 * deletion leaves nothing tied to the user, not even an anonymized usage row.
